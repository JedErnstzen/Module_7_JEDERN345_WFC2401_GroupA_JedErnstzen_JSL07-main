# [JSL07] Submission: Proud of your Progress

Create a personalized certificate of achievement with the "Proud of Your Progress Certificate Generator". This web application requires users to input their name, a personalized message, and the course name to dynamically generate a certificate displayed in a modal.

## Steps for Submission
1. **Clone Starter Code:** Begin by cloning the Starter Code Repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_7_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL07).
2. **Develop Your Solution:** Write your code to implement the project's functionality.
3. **Commit Your Changes:** As you make progress, commit your changes with meaningful messages.
4. **Push to GitHub:** Upload your local repository changes to GitHub.
5. **Submit Your Work:** Share your GitHub Repository Link on the LMS under the [JSL07] Submission Project Tab.

## Project Features
- **Input Fields:** For user's name, personalized message, and course name.
- **Generate Certificate:** A button that when clicked, creates the certificate.
- **Modal Display:** The certificate is shown in a modal window.
- **Close Button:** For closing the modal.
- **Validation:** Checks that all fields are completed before certificate generation.

## Development Objectives
- **Dynamic Content:** Dynamically generate the certificate's content based on user input, ensuring it matches the reference solution.
- **Modal Implementation:** Show the certificate in a modal upon form submission; the modal should initially be hidden.
- **Interaction Handling:** Enable modal display with form submission and allow closing with a close button. Ensure form inputs are cleared post-submission.
